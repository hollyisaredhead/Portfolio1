    <hr>
    <img src="" class="left-float">
    <p>Hi, I'm Holly. I'm an aspiring developer who hopes to become literate in many coding languages. 
        In the future I would love to create websites and apps with my new found skills. I recently joined
        a coding bootcamp that is giving me the knowledge to make this dream a reality.
    </p>
    <p> I enjoy doing arts and crafts, outdoorsy activities, and yoga when I'm not coding. Yoga allows me to 
        focus and center myself especially when life becomes extremely busy and chaotic.
